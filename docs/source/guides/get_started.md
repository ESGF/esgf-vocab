# Get Started

## Installation

```bash
pip install esgvoc
```

## Fetch vocabularies

Right after ESGVOC installation, the vocabularies can be installed following this command:

```bash
esgvoc install
```

```{eval-rst}
.. warning::
  Do not forget to fetch the vocabularies as ESGVOC will fail at anything!
```

Let's continue with the [basic ESGVOC notebook](basics_esgvoc.ipynb), the tutorial of the library and the [CLI commands](basic_cli.md) that describes the command line tool shipped with the library.
