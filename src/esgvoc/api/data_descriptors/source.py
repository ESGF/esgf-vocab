    Source of the dataset

    Examples: "CanESM6-MR", "CR-CMIP-1-0-0"

    The more precise meaning of source depends on the kind of dataset this is.
    For model output, 'source' refers to a numerical representations of the Earth's climate system.
    This source is the model which was used to generate the dataset.
    Such models simulate the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.
    They are based on fundamental physical, chemical, and biological processes
    and are used to understand past, present, and future climate conditions.
    Each source or model is typically associated with a specific research institution, center, or group.
    For instance, models like 'EC-Earth' are developed by a consortium of European institutes,
    while 'GFDL-CM4' is developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in the United States.

    For model inputs i.e. forcings, the 'source' is a unique identifier
    for the group that produced the data and its version.
    This is a different convention from almost all other cases
    (which really muddies the meaning of the term).

    It can also just be the same as `label`
    if the person registering the source wishes.
