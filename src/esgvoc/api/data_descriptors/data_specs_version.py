    The data specifications describe the overall set of data specifications
    used when writing the dataset.
    This version number captures exactly which set of data specifications
    are consistent (or intended to be consistent) with this dataset.
    (At the moment, exactly what this means is still vague, particularly for CMIP7.
    When it solidifies, more details and examples will be added here.)
