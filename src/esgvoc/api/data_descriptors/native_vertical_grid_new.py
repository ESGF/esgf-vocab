    4.2. Vertical grid
    The model component's native vertical grid is described by a subset of the following properties:
        • Description
            ◦ A free-text description of the vertical grid.
            ◦ A description is only required if there is information that is not covered by any of the other properties.
            ◦ Omit if not needed.
        • Coordinate
            ◦ The coordinate type of the vertical grid.
            ◦ Taken from a standardised list: 7.11. coordinate CV.
            ◦ If there is no vertical grid, then the value "none" must be selected, and no other properties should be set.
            ◦ E.g. height
            ◦ E.g. none
        • N z
            ◦ The number of layers (i.e. grid cells) in the Z direction.
            ◦ Omit when not applicable or not constant.
            ◦ If the number of layers varies in time or across the horizontal grid, then the N z range property may be used instead.
            ◦ E.g. 70
        • N z range
            ◦ The minimum and maximum number of layers for vertical grids with a time- or space-varying number of layers.
            ◦ Omit if the N z property has been set.
            ◦ E.g. 5, 15
        • Bottom layer thickness
            ◦ The thickness of the bottom model layer (i.e. the layer closest to the centre of the Earth).
            ◦ The value should be reported as a dimensional (as opposed to parametric) quantity.
            ◦ If the value varies in time or across the horizontal grid, then provide a nominal or typical value.
            ◦ The value's physical units are given by the vertical_units property.
            ◦ Omit when not applicable.
            ◦ E.g. 10
        • Top layer thickness
            ◦ The thickness of the top model layer (i.e. the layer furthest away from the centre of the Earth).
            ◦ The value should be reported as a dimensional (as opposed to parametric) quantity.
            ◦ If the value varies in time or across the horizontal grid, then provide a nominal or typical value.
            ◦ The value's physical units are given by the vertical_units property.
            ◦ Omit when not applicable.
            ◦ E.g. 10
        • Top of model
            ◦ The upper boundary of the top model layer (i.e. the upper boundary of the layer that is furthest away from the centre of the Earth).
            ◦ The value should be relative to the lower boundary of the bottom layer of the model, or an appropriate datum (such as mean sea level).
            ◦ The value should be reported as a dimensional (as opposed to parametric) quantity.
            ◦ The value's physical units are given by the vertical_units property.
            ◦ Omit when not applicable or not constant.
            ◦ E.g. 85003.5
        • Vertical units
            ◦ The physical units of the bottom_layer_thickness, top_layer_thickness, and top_of_model property values.
            ◦ Taken from a standardised list: 7.12. vertical_units CV.
            ◦ Omit when not applicable.
            ◦ E.g. m
